""" variables
What is a variable?
    RAM = short term memory (if you power off the machine for 2-5 seconds,
        all ram loses its values)
    
        much faster than SSDs or especially old spinning hard disks.
        
    variables are stored in ram.
    
    variables are assigned into a "memory location"
    
    variables store results from calculations, they are our way to "remember things"
    
    how do you declare a variable in python?

        Variables must start with _ or a letter, not a number
        Variables names are made up letters, numbers, and underscores
            not !, @, #, $, %
